CRUD 

Create, read, update, delete (get, post delete, put, patch)

start a server (app.listen(3000, callback function))


app.get
app.post
app.put
etc

this is front end code that will sen stuff back to the server.  

app.post("the url that you want this to be listening on" "/users", (request, response) callback function)

response.send ({json})
response.status -this is the status you're sending back (201, 409)

201 means created
409 means conflict (because the username is already taken, so server can't create that entity).
400 means bad request 


app.listen is the final thing you need to write to get the express server to be listening on this port.  it's normally at the bottom of your app.js file.
